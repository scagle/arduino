   (In short: Do what you want, just be sure to include this line and the four above it, and don't sell it or use it in anything you sell without contacting me.)
   
   Analog Pin 0: Piezo speaker (connected to ground with 1M pulldown resistor)
   Digital Pin 2: Switch to enter a new code.  Short this to enter programming mode.
   Digital Pin 3: DC gear reduction motor attached to the lock. (Or a motor controller or a solenoid or other unlocking mechanisim.)
   Digital Pin 4: Red LED. 
   Digital Pin 5: Green LED. 
   
   Update: Nov 09 09: Fixed red/green LED error in the comments. Code is unchanged. 
   Update: Nov 20 09: Updated handling of programming button to make it more intuitive, give better feedback.
   Update: Jan 20 10: Removed the "pinMode(knockSensor, OUTPUT);" line since it makes no sense and doesn't do anything.
